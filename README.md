# Golf-Game
Verilog FPGA, Golf Game project using IR sensors.

The player has 30 secs (timer is displayed on FPGA seven segment displayer) to put the ball in 3 holes of the golf board (this project involves hardware too). The player will put the ball in holes A, B and then C, with the score incrementing by 1 each time. The score will be displayed on a VGA screen. The game will end once the ball goes in all the holes or when the timer hits 30 secs.
